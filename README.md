When building your applications, you will probably end up needing to call APIs or fetch data from external sources. Leaf provides a simple and easy way to do this using Fetch. Fetch provides a clean and modern interface for making network requests in PHP. It is inspired by JavaScript's Fetch API, Axios and uses elements from Unirest PHP.

## fetch example

```php
$res = fetch('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/');

// data returned is saved in the $data property just like axios
response()->json($res->data);
```

You can also use the entire fetch object to make requests:

```php
$res = fetch()->post('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts', [
  'title' => 'foo',
  'body' => 'bar',
  'userId' => 1
]);

fetch()->put(...);
fetch()->patch(...);
fetch()->delete(...);
fetch()->options(...);

response()->json($res->data);
```

*Fetch is still in its early stages and is being actively developed. If you have any issues or suggestions, please feel free to open an issue or a pull request.*

## Installation

You can quickly install leaf fetch with the Leaf CLI

```sh

```sh
